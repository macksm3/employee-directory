## Installation
This app resides on the github server and is accessed with a web browser.

## Usage
This app is a simple directory page, the list can be sorted by column and a search is available for each column. For table creation, the react-table module was chosen. one odd behavior noticed is that the sort function has 3 states, clicking the column heading cycles through sort assending, sort decending and sort off.
